## üî¨ Technical Sophistication

### Low-Level Programming
```swift
// AI generated binary protocol handling
frame.append(withUnsafeBytes(of: UInt32(frameLength).littleEndian) { Data($0) })
frame.append(withUnsafeBytes(of: frameType.littleEndian) { Data($0) })
```

### State Management
```swift
// AI designed reliability state machine
private var sequenceNumber: UInt32 = 0
private var pendingMessages: [UInt32: PendingMessage] = [:]
private var receivedSequences: Set<UInt32> = []
private var outOfOrderBuffer: [UInt32: Data] = [:]
```

### Concurrency Patterns
```swift
// AI implemented async timer management
private var heartbeatTimer: Timer?
private var retransmissionTimer: Timer?

private func startRetransmissionCheck() {
    retransmissionTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: timeout) { _ in
        Task { await self.checkRetransmissions() }
    }
}
```
